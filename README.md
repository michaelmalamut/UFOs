# UFO Sightings

## Overview of the Project

Dana wants to provide a more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings by allowing users to filter multiple criteria at the same time. The criteria that can be filtered will include the Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

## Resources

* Data Source: data.js
* Language: JavaScript
* Visual Studio Code 1.66.2

## Results

Data set was too large so Dana decided to add filters to allow users to only see data that is matching their search results.

This is what a user would see upon entering the site and seeing the data set. The filter search on the left of the page would be used to filter through the five criteria to get the results they are looking for.
